QUORADAY
========

An android app that poses one question a day, pulled from the internet. Users
can respond to the question, either publically or privately. Users can view
posts of the day and 'star' them. Top starred responses of the day can be
viewed by the user.

All user responses are stored in a mysql database and pulled upon request.

A lot of work needs to be done to make all functionality.
